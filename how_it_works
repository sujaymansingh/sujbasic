The idea is:

10 LET a = 10

This gets parsed, and then compiled down to some python obj:

StatementLet(varname='a', Expression(Term(Factor(FactorWithLiteral, '10'))))

This in turn gets converted to some VM language (for now forth):

VARIABLE a 10 a !

We'd have to have some form of program counter or something.
